<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><em>Newgrange - World Heritage Site</em></strong></h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>Newgrange is a Stone Age (Neolithic) monument in the Boyne Valley, County Meath, it is the jewel in the crown of Ireland's Ancient East.
 Newgrange was constructed about 5,200 years ago (3,200 B.C.) which makes it older than Stonehenge and the Great Pyramids of Giza. Newgrange
 is a large circular mound 85m (279ft) in diameter and 13m (43ft) high with a 19m (63ft) stone passageway and chambers inside. The mound is 
 ringed by 97 large <a href="https://www.newgrange.com/kerbstones.htm">Kerbstones</a>, some of which are engraved with symbols 
called megalithic art.</p>
<br>

<p>Newgrange was built by a farming community that prospered on the rich lands of the Boyne Valley. <a href="https://www.newgrange.com/knowth.htm">Knowth </a>  
and<a href="https://www.newgrange.com/dowth.htm">Dowth</a> similar mounds that
 together with Newgrange have been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

Archaeologists classified Newgrange as a passage tomb, however Newgrange is now recognised to be much more than a passage tomb. Ancient Temple
 is a more fitting classification, a place of astrological, spiritual, religious and ceremonial importance, much as present day cathedrals are 
 places of prestige and worship where dignitaries may be laid to rest.

Newgrange is a large kidney shaped mound covering an area of over one acre, retained at the base by 97 kerbstones, some of which are richly
 decorated with megalithic art. The 19m long inner passage leads to a cruciform chamber with a corbelled roof. The amount of time and labour 
 invested in construction of Newgrange suggests a well-organized society with specialised groups responsible for different aspects of construction.

Newgrange is part of a complex of monuments built along a bend of the River Boyne known collectively as Brú na Bóinne. The other two principal
 monuments are  (the largest) and Dowth, but throughout the area there are as many as 35 smaller mounds.</p>

 <p>Newgrange is best known for the illumination of its passage and chamber by the winter solstice sun. Above the entrance
 to the passage at Newgrange there is a opening called a roof-box. This baffling orifice held a great surprise for those who 
 unearthed it. Its purpose is to allow sunlight to penetrate the chamber on the shortest days of the year, around December 21st,
 the <a href="https://www.newgrange.com/dowth.htm">winter solstice</a>. At dawn, from December 19th to 23rd, a narrow beam of light penetrates the roof-box and reaches the floor 
 of the chamber, gradually extending to the rear of the chamber.

As the sun rises higher, the beam widens within the chamber so that the whole room becomes dramatically illuminated. This event lasts
 for 17 minutes, beginning around 9am. The accuracy of Newgrange as a time-telling device is remarkable when one considers that it was 
 built 500 years before the Great Pyramids and more than 1,000 years before Stonehenge.

The intent of the Stone Age farmers who build Newgrange was undoubtedly to mark the beginning of the new year. In addition, it may have
 served as a powerful symbol of the victory of life over death.

Each year the winter solstice event attracts much attention at Newgrange. Many gather at the ancient tomb to wait for dawn, as people did
 5,000 years ago. So great is the demand to be one of the few inside the chamber during the solstice that there is a free annual lottery
 (application forms are available at the Visitor Centre). Unfortunately, as with many Irish events that depend upon sunshine, if the skies
 are overcast, there is not much to be seen. Yet all agree that it is an extraordinary feeling to wait in the darkness, as people did so
 long ago, for the longest night of the year to end.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><em>Understanding Neolithics</em></strong></h2>
<br>
<p>In our fast-paced, technologically advanced society, we give little thought to where our fruits, vegetables, and grains come from as we shop in the grocery store. Indeed, many people in the United States 
and other parts of the developed world have moved away from an agriculturally-based lifestyle.

However, agriculture was one of the most important developments in all of human history, which occurred during what historians call the
 Neolithic Age. Let's define this period, and look into some of its characteristics, paying special attention to the Agricultural Revolution.

The Neolithic Age began around 12,000 years ago and ended as civilizations started to rise around 3500 BCE. The term Neolithic comes from
 two words: neo, or new, and lithic, or stone. As such, this time period is sometimes referred to as the New Stone Age.

Humans in the Neolithic Age still used stone tools and weapons, but they were starting to enhance their stone tools. There's evidence of 
initial metallurgy as well, and also creating more pottery.

But what really distinguishes the New Stone Age from the Old Stone Age, or Paleolithic Age, that preceded it, is a very important characteristic 
that is the key feature of the time period: the invention of agriculture.</p>

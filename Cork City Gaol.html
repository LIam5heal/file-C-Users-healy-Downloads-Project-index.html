<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Cork City Gaol: History And All The Things You Need To Know</strong></h2>
<br>
<div id="container">
<div class="coll">
<h2 class="heading"> Column 1</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Cork City Gaol is an important part of Cork’s historical and cultural heritage. The Gaol is located at Cork’s Northside
 in an area called Sunday’s Well, and easily accessible from the city centre. The building kind of resembles a castle, and
 well preserved despite being at least a couple of centuries old.</p>
 <p>The place may have a grim history but it is regarded as one of the finest examples of Ireland’s architectural heritage.
 This former prison is now one of the most fascinating attractions in Cork. Touring the Cork City Gaol is a little strange, 
 but quite fun and informative.</p>
 <p>In the 1700s, there is already a Gaol in Cork, located in the heart of the city at the North Gate Bridge.

However, this old Gaol was in a confined site. The old prison also became too crowded abd therefore, unhygienic for
 its ‘residents’. It was agreed upon that a new gaol, one better suited to ‘modern’ times, was necessary.</p></div>
 
 <div class="col2">
<h2 class="heading"> Column 2</h2>
<p class="paragraph">An Act of Parliament was passed to build the Cork City Gaol in 1906. The start of the actual construction took a while but it was eventually done. 

The new Cork City Gaol opened in 1824, and it was hailed as “the best in three kingdoms”.  The Gaol housed both male and females who committed crimes within the city boundary. The ones who committed crimes outside of Cork City were sent to the Cork County Gaol instead.

Meanwhile, those sentenced to death were executed by hanging from the gatehouse of the prison. The gatehouse is the area that’s most visible to onlookers and passers-by.

People can only see Gaol’s main prison after they have passed through the gatehouse first. The Cork City Gaol may be grand,  but the gatehouse is a reminder of its grim purpose.

In 1868, hangings were eventually stopped.</p>
<p>During the 1870s, many changes took place in the Goal. The West Wing was renovated to make it brighter and more spacious.

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Oakum Picking</h3>
<br>

<p>The task of picking and preparation was a common occupation in prisons and workhouses, where the young or 
the old and infirm were put to work unpicking oakum if they were unsuited for heavier labour. Sailors undergoing 
naval punishment were also frequently sentenced to unpick oakum, with each man made to unpick 1 pound (450 g) of oakum a day.</p>
<br>
<h3 style="text-align:left;">Sir Thomas Deane</h3>
<br>
<p>Sir Thomas Deane’s impressive construction, the Cork City Gaol, opened in 1824 and operated for nearly 100 years as a prison for 
the city’s criminals. At one time, reported to be ‘the finest in three kingdoms,’ the Gaol imprisoned citizens for infractions
 ranging from assault to stealing bread to exhibiting simple drunkenness and it was, for a while, an all female prison.

The Gaol ceased all operation in 1923 and the complex was left abandoned for 70 years when it finally underwent a modern restoration
 and was reopened to the public as a visitor attraction. Today, visitors can, ironically, roam freely throughout the prison and develop
 great insight into the day-to-day lives of some of Cork City’s unluckiest former residents.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">Wonen's Gaol</h3>
<br>
<p>To the older generation around Sunday’s Well the place with the “big high walls” is often referred to as the “Women’s Gaol”. 
This is because in the early years its use was for a time confined to female prisoners. It became the “Women’s Gaol” in 1878 and 
on that particular day the men were marched out of Sunday’s Well Prison and over to the County Gaol off Western Road, while the women
were marched in the opposite direction into Sunday’s Well. When the prison was originally built in the 1820’s it housed both male
 and female prisoners, whose crimes were committed within the city boundary. Anyone committing a crime outside that boundary were
 committed to the County Gaol, across the river from the City Gaol, of which only the preserved facade now remains, where University
 College Cork now stands. During the latter years of British occupation, a number of harmless female convicts were detained in the Women’s Gaol,
 and these were often taken for walks along the Blarney Road under the supervision of their wardresses. Republican women prisoners during the 
 war of independence and the civil war were also imprisoned there. These included many leading members of Cumann na mBan, the prominent patriotic
 northside lady, Mary Bowles, and possibly the greatest Republican woman of them all, Countess Constance Markievicz. She became the first woman
 to be elected to the British Parliament in 1918, and was also Minister for Labour in the first Dail in 1919.</p>
 <br>
 <h3 style="text-align:left;">The Great Escape</h3>
<br>
<p>A spectacular escape was made from the Women’s Gaol in November 1923. Its inmates then were not
 those suggested by the name, but a collection of hardened I.R.A. veterans who were singled out on
 specific charges and were dealt with later, at the convenience of the Government. Among other charges,
 this group were caught boring a tunnel, had being on hunger strike and were sent to the Women’</p>
